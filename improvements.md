## Next Steps / Key Priorities

### ‚úÖ Bug Fixes (COMPLETED)
1.  **‚úÖ XX Handshake Pattern Fix (COMPLETED):**
    *   **Issue:** ‚úÖ Authentication failure during static key decryption in the XX pattern.
    *   **Solution:** ‚úÖ Fixed incorrect static key initialization requirement. XX pattern discovers keys during handshake rather than requiring pre-shared keys.

### üöÄ Core Implementation Enhancements
1.  **Cryptographic Agility:**
    *   **Goal:** Allow users to easily plug in different standard Noise cryptographic primitives (e.g., AESGCM, SHA512, different elliptic curves like P-256, Curve448).
    *   **Action:** Refactor core logic to be generic over the defined `DiffieHellmanFunction`, `CipherFunction`, and `HashFunction` protocols. This is a foundational step for broader applicability.
2.  **‚úÖ Expanded Handshake Pattern Support (COMPLETED):**
    *   **Goal:** ‚úÖ Implement a wider range of handshake patterns defined in the Noise specification.
    *   **Status:** ‚úÖ Successfully added support for N, K, X, IX, IK patterns with comprehensive test coverage. All patterns work correctly with proper static key initialization.
3.  **‚úÖ Pre-shared Key (PSK) Modes (COMPLETED):**
    *   **Goal:** ‚úÖ Enable PSK-based handshakes for different security models, a common requirement in many Noise deployments.
    *   **Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented comprehensive PSK support with `.psk` token handling and 5 PSK pattern variants. Ready for production use.

### ‚úÖ Testing & Validation
1.  **‚úÖ Official Test Vectors (COMPLETED):**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure correctness and interoperability with other Noise libraries.
    *   **Status:** ‚úÖ Added official test vector validation using cacophony test vectors for 25519_ChaChaPoly_SHA256 cipher suite. Both NN and NK patterns validated with official payloads.
2.  **`getHandshakeHash()` Validation:**
    *   **Goal:** Verify the correctness of the handshake hash, which is often used in higher-level protocols.
    *   **Action:** Add tests to compare `NoiseSession.getHandshakeHash()` output against values from official test vectors or reference implementations for corresponding handshake sequences.
3.  **Broader Handshake Pattern Test Coverage:**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure all implemented patterns are thoroughly tested with various configurations.
    *   **Action:** As new patterns are added (see Core Implementation Enhancements), create comprehensive tests for each. Include variations with and without static keys, PSKs (once supported), and different prologue lengths.

## Further Enhancements (Optional Future Roadmap)

### üîê Security & Robustness
1.  **Rekeying Mechanism:**
    *   **Goal:** Maintain forward secrecy and cryptographic hygiene for long-lived sessions.
    *   **Action:** Implement and document an automatic or manual rekeying strategy for `NoiseSession` as per Noise specification recommendations (e.g., after a specific number of messages or amount of data exchanged).
2.  **Advanced Failure Scenario Testing (Continuous Improvement):**
    *   **Goal:** Improve resilience against malformed inputs and unexpected conditions.
    *   **Action:** Continue expanding negative tests, covering more subtle edge cases for:
        *   Tampered or malformed messages (e.g., incorrect MAC, modified ciphertext, incorrect lengths at different stages).
        *   Receiving unexpected or out-of-order handshake messages.
        *   Nonce exhaustion/overflow in `CipherState` (ensure robust handling beyond just error throwing).
3.  **Fuzz Testing:**
    *   **Goal:** Proactively uncover potential vulnerabilities with a wide range of unexpected inputs.
    *   **Action:** Consider implementing fuzz testing for handshake message parsing and cryptographic operations, especially as more patterns and crypto suites are added.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Usability & Performance
1.  **Concurrency Model (Async/Await):**
    *   **Goal:** Improve usability in modern Swift applications, particularly for networking tasks.
    *   **Action:** Explore adding support for Swift's `async/await` for handshake and message operations, or provide very clear documentation and examples for thread-safe usage in concurrent environments.
2.  **Comprehensive Documentation & Examples (Continuous Improvement):**
    *   **Goal:** Make the library easy for developers to understand, use correctly, and integrate.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Maintain and enhance inline code comments, especially for complex logic in `HandshakeState` and `SymmetricState`.
        *   Provide comprehensive API documentation (e.g., using DocC), keeping it updated with new features.
        *   Expand usage examples to showcase different patterns, PSK usage, error handling, and integration with `async/await` if implemented.
3.  **Payload Variation Testing (Continuous Improvement):**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure robust handling of different payload sizes and types across all operations.
    *   **Action:** Continue to expand tests for empty payloads, very large payloads (approaching the 65535-byte limit), and payloads included in various handshake messages where permitted by the pattern.
4.  **Stateful Interaction & Transport Phase Tests (Continuous Improvement):**
    *   **Goal:** Verify correct behavior during extended transport sessions, including potential rekeying.
    *   **Action:** Expand tests for exchanging multiple messages post-handshake, interleaved sending/receiving by both parties, and scenarios involving rekeying (once implemented).

This updated list reflects the recent progress and prioritizes the next set of critical improvements for the library.
