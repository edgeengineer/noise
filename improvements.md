## Further Enhancements (Optional Future Roadmap)

### üîê Security & Robustness
1.  **‚úÖ Rekeying Mechanism (COMPLETED):**
    *   **Goal:** ‚úÖ Maintain forward secrecy and cryptographic hygiene for long-lived sessions.
    *   **Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented comprehensive rekeying functionality:
        - **Manual rekeying**: `session.rekey()` for coordinated forward secrecy
        - **Automatic rekeying policies**: Message count, time interval, nonce threshold triggers
        - **Session statistics**: Monitor message counts, timing, and rekeying behavior
        - **Policy management**: Flexible `RekeyPolicy` enum with multiple strategies
        - **Coordinated operation**: Both parties must rekey simultaneously for synchronization
        - **9 comprehensive tests** covering all rekeying scenarios and edge cases
2.  **Advanced Failure Scenario Testing (Continuous Improvement):**
    *   **Goal:** Improve resilience against malformed inputs and unexpected conditions.
    *   **Action:** Continue expanding negative tests, covering more subtle edge cases for:
        *   Tampered or malformed messages (e.g., incorrect MAC, modified ciphertext, incorrect lengths at different stages).
        *   Receiving unexpected or out-of-order handshake messages.
        *   Nonce exhaustion/overflow in `CipherState` (ensure robust handling beyond just error throwing).
3.  **Fuzz Testing:**
    *   **Goal:** Proactively uncover potential vulnerabilities with a wide range of unexpected inputs.
    *   **Action:** Consider implementing fuzz testing for handshake message parsing and cryptographic operations, especially as more patterns and crypto suites are added.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Usability & Performance
1.  **Concurrency Model (Async/Await):**
    *   **Goal:** Improve usability in modern Swift applications, particularly for networking tasks.
    *   **Action:** Explore adding support for Swift's `async/await` for handshake and message operations, or provide very clear documentation and examples for thread-safe usage in concurrent environments.
2.  **Comprehensive Documentation & Examples (Continuous Improvement):**
    *   **Goal:** Make the library easy for developers to understand, use correctly, and integrate.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Maintain and enhance inline code comments, especially for complex logic in `HandshakeState` and `SymmetricState`.
        *   Provide comprehensive API documentation (e.g., using DocC), keeping it updated with new features.
        *   Expand usage examples to showcase different patterns, PSK usage, error handling, and integration with `async/await` if implemented.
3.  **Payload Variation Testing (Continuous Improvement):**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure robust handling of different payload sizes and types across all operations.
    *   **Action:** Continue to expand tests for empty payloads, very large payloads (approaching the 65535-byte limit), and payloads included in various handshake messages where permitted by the pattern.
4.  **Stateful Interaction & Transport Phase Tests (Continuous Improvement):**
    *   **Goal:** Verify correct behavior during extended transport sessions, including potential rekeying.
    *   **Action:** Expand tests for exchanging multiple messages post-handshake, interleaved sending/receiving by both parties, and scenarios involving rekeying (once implemented).

This updated list reflects the recent progress and prioritizes the next set of critical improvements for the library.
